### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ita Enang. I am a full stack Software Engineer trained at ALX school where we do hard things.
I am currently working on a mobile app that will soon be deployed to both the App store and Play Store using React Native with Expo.
I am also in the last month of my specialization in Backend Software Engineering at ALX.


My main workflow is: Python && Typescript && React Native with expo && NativeWind.

But I am also skilled with: C, MySQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

I know devops but I don't enjoy it so much.

With Design I use, Canva, Photoshop, Procreate and several CAD modelling software really well.

I look forward to getting on a call with you.
